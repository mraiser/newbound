You can extend your apps with commands written in Python or Java. Simply define the commands your app accepts and the parameters for those commands, and the software turns your code into an easy-to-use API automatically. Add the user interface by providing your app's HTML and CSS. Then make it come to life with a little Javascript. MetaBot automatically generates Javascript functions for you to call commands on the back-end. Preview your work before you publish. When it's finished, just hit the publish button and your app is immediately available over your personal Newbound network.\n","db":"metabot","desc":""},"readers":["anonymous"],"id":"gwsqnm16505669437o159d","sessionid":"jvgvwg16b7a4d277bt3","time":1574954038416,"addr":"/0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1:49192","username":"admin"}
